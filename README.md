# README

## Overview

This is a machine learning library that I've created to go over some of the fundamentals of ML using primarily TensorFlow.

## Installation and Usage

Run ```python -r requirements.txt``` to download the necessary modules.

After retrieving the necessary data for the eu4 processing files, you can run the main files, located in the base directory of the repo, to test certain models.

## Attributions and Disclaimers

Inspiration and some small bits of code are taken from the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) TensorFlow code snippets, as well as this TensorFlow Project Template repo, found [here](https://github.com/Mrgemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template).
